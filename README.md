# Oyster-Card Challenge
-----------------------

During week 2 of Makers Academy, we were tasked with simulating the process of using an oystercard during a journey from one station to another. The aim of this task was to build on our pre-existing TDD skills and familiarity with RSpec and OOP.

This challenge also served as a vessel for introducing concepts such as class dependencies, the use of doubles, encapsulation, class extraction and polymorphism.

## Approach
-----------

The first 13 steps of this task were relatively simple, asking us to re-visit concepts and syntax previously mastered in week 1. After following the instructions, we were left with an Oystercard class that had far too many responsibilities and methods. It was at this point that a new Journey class had to be extrapolated, taking with it certain responsibilities.

The issue that many of us faced was creating this new class, and giving it the responsibilities first given to the oystercard. This meant many of our previous RSpec tests failed, and new and more complex doubles had to be created.

Despite acting as a wall between us and completing the task, it's complexity taught us valuable lessons.

## What have I learned
----------------------

The challenges I faced in step 14 helped me to understand how planning a solution to a user story extensively beforehand, can save me a lot of time in the future. By implementing concepts such as class extraction at the outset when modelling the program, I can save myself the problem of having to do it later, and seeing all my current unit tests fail.

Due to the repetitiveness of re-doing step 14 with different pairs, I was given the opportunity to consolidate my understanding of doubles and mock tests, and practice correct syntax and thorough refactoring. Although I never surpassed step 14, I feel as if I made progress with my learning and understanding every time I tackled it.
